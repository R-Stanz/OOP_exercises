In this exercise you should, only, create a program
that is capable of using an object that represents
a book. If you need some inspiration to set an 
objective for what you'll do with object, you can
set an author name, the release year and a title.

For now you don't need any input and the object only
has attributes.

To help you there is a template file named
"Main.java".
